# Arctic Image Processing

Processing scripts for the AO / Beaufort Sea datasets.

Scripts here currently for L2 MODISA and above.

Software:
* R (packages ncdf4, stringr, sp)
* Python (> v3 with numpy and netCDF4)
* GMT 

Note that:
* Delta (raised albedo) files have suffix "delta" used to ID them in the daily composite script
* In that script, for raised albedo files a shapefile or box can be used to crop
